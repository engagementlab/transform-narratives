The bracingly honest interviews featured in this piece reflect the trust in process that was made possible through truly collaborative work. The \"direct animation\" or painted film strips seen throughout the film were created by students and partners in response to the prompt: \"represent how you feel when you think about gun violence in your life and in your community.\" The result is visually stunning and emotionally charged transitions throughout."}]}]},"videos":[{"label":"Quiet Rooms","thumb":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/1422970532-23861873f4eeecd50dbcdcf692a557391ce2f75e0cdc82314dc6c54f8fe5cca1-d_1920x1080?r=pad","value":"https://player.vimeo.com/video/704690044?h=1983e7467b","caption":"","thumbSm":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/1422970532-23861873f4eeecd50dbcdcf692a557391ce2f75e0cdc82314dc6c54f8fe5cca1-d_200x150?r=pad"}],"thumbnail":{"publicId":"tngvi/media/cl2jm37cg0000tepsb00l958a"}},"relatedItems":[]},"__N_SSG":true}
