Creative interventions, strategies and solutions are urgently needed to end this crisis. Throughout the semester, a diverse group of 13 undergraduate theatre students explored gun violence prevention, as well as support systems for survivors of homicide through an applied theatre lens, building an understanding of how theatre artists have used their skills, creativity and community engagement strategies to address the root causes of gun violence: systemic racism, poverty and toxic masculinity. Through arts-based research, applied theatre activities, community participant story sharings and a long-term devising process, students collaboratively write, create and perform original theatre addressing gun violence and offering calls to action."}]},{"type":"heading","level":3,"children":[{"text":"Problem Space"}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Attempting to align the schedules and values of overly busy, theatre production-oriented undergraduate students with the gentle, trust-building practices of community engagement has been the most challenging part of our process and collaboration. Relationships take time to build and trust must be earned and yet we have time crunches within the semester to reach certain learning goals, assignment deadlines, performance expectations and end-of-semester realities. We attempted to move, as activist adrienne marie brown writes, “at the speed of trust” which meant many pivots, changes to the syllabus and the performance structures. Students had the opportunity to move through this journey in real time as we attempted to connect with partners, listen to their stories and then create performers inspired by the experiences of the survivors. We struggled with issues of representation and our own identities and experiences might inform the pieces we create and the stories we feel we have “a right” to tell onstage."}]},{"type":"heading","level":3,"children":[{"text":"Studio Approach and Engagement"}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Our class included multiple approaches to engage with the materials as well as our partners. We read and discussed research about gun violence; its root causes, impact and prevention strategies. Additionally, we studied plays and even a young adult novel that addressed gun violence using creative and innovation forms to engage readers and audiences. We invited several guests to our class to help us understand the context and breadth of this issue, and its impact on survivors. Doctors Peter Masikos and Chana Saks. Co-Directors of Mass General Hospital’s Center for Gun Violence Prevention shared their experiences in the hospital, recent research projects and the goals and vision for their center.

We collaboratively devised one performance that threaded the pieces together and thoughtfully considered how and where and if to share it publicly. Additionally, we studied and practiced the interactive performance technique of Forum Theater, a technique from Brazilian theater activist Augusto Boal’s Theater of the Oppressed and used this structure to create short skits addressing issues related to how hospital staff and doctors relate to gun violence survivors and their families, to be performed at the hospital as part of an interactive, community strategizing session."}]}]},{"type":"layout-area","children":[{"type":"heading","level":4,"children":[{"text":"Creators"}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Kyle Berry, student"}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Mikayla Brown, student"}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"McKennen Campbell, student"}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Alexandra Chéry-Dorrelus, partner"}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Demean Crawford, student"}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Maudrie Depradine, partner"}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Allison Earl, student"}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Tori Eriavez, student"}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Lee Forrest, student"}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Juliette Hoernle, student"}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Rainier Pearl-Styles, TA"}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Tiana Perez-Toro, student"}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Dr. Sherri Raftery, partner"}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Rachel Tabin, student"}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Maia Tivony, student"}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Ethan Williams, student"}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Allie Witek, student"}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Dana Edell, professor"}]},{"type":"heading","level":4,"children":[{"text":"Partners"}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":""},{"href":"https://www.massgeneral.org/gun-violence-prevention","type":"link","children":[{"text":"Mass General Hospital"}]},{"text":""}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":""},{"href":"https://ldbpeaceinstitute.org","type":"link","children":[{"text":"Peace Institute"}]},{"text":""}]},{"type":"heading","level":4,"children":[{"text":"Department"}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":""},{"href":"https://www.emerson.edu/academics/academic-departments/performing-arts","type":"link","children":[{"text":"Performing Arts"}]},{"text":""}]},{"type":"heading","level":4,"children":[{"text":"Contact"}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"dana_edell@emerson.edu"}]}]}]},{"type":"heading","level":3,"children":[{"text":"Studio Outcomes"}]},{"type":"component-block","props":{"video":{"label":"TH315: Showcase Performance","thumb":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/1450218687-03bdc3fb0a220f5e0489b51bc836a72f7db6c158eaeed6bbc08d95b60aacc1ba-d_1920x1080?r=pad","value":"https://player.vimeo.com/video/719880309?h=24d94eb024","thumbSm":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/1450218687-03bdc3fb0a220f5e0489b51bc836a72f7db6c158eaeed6bbc08d95b60aacc1ba-d_200x150?r=pad"}},"children":[{"type":"component-inline-prop","children":[{"text":""}]}],"component":"video"},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":""}]}]}},"relatedItems":[{"name":"VM495: Documentary Studio (Spring 2020)","key":"vm495-documentary-studio-spring-2020","filters":[],"thumbnail":{"publicId":"tngvi/studios/cl282fdar00015ips34jycc6j"}},{"name":"Co-Creation of VR and 360-Video","key":"co-creation-of-vr-and-360-video","filters":[],"thumbnail":{"publicId":"tngvi/studios/cl282eiqr00005ips1hed1wqw"}},{"name":"VM 495: Documentary Studio (Spring 2022)","key":"vm-495-documentary-studio-spring-2022","filters":[],"thumbnail":{"publicId":"tngvi/studios/cl282fk8700025ipscl4b2z3j"}},{"name":"TH315 Performing Solutions: A Dramatic Approach to Gun Violence Prevention","key":"th315-performing-solutions-a-dramatic-approach-to-gun-violence-prevention","filters":[],"thumbnail":{"publicId":"tngvi/studios/cl4hcap8w0001t4psh8jg9gf4"}}]},"__N_SSG":true}
