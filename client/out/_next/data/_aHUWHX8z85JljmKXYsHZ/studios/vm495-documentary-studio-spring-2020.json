Media narratives typically report on yet another shooting in the inner city, or the performative shock of yet another mass shooting. But they ignore the after effects, the personal struggles, the deep ripples in communities, and the systemic racism that perpetuates it all."}]},{"type":"heading","level":3,"children":[{"text":"Studio Approach & Engagement"},{"bold":true,"text":" "}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"This studio embraced the complexity of co-creation. Emerson students worked directly with community partners who audited the course and participated each week. The first half of the semester focused on relationship building, informal story telling (without cameras), sourcing the stories that need to be told, and exploring creative possibilities. The second half of the semester focused on production and post-production. The result is a process where students and partners mutually reinforce the passion for the story they’re telling. The process is one that foregrounds gratitude (from Emerson students to the partners for graciously sharing their experiences, and from partners to Emerson students for graciously sharing their skills and drive to create)."}]},{"type":"component-block","props":{"image":{"alt":"A group of people with their hands together in the middle.","publicId":"tngvi/cl28dbb7200175ips6tfacygb"}},"children":[{"type":"component-inline-prop","children":[{"text":""}]}],"component":"image"},{"type":"heading","level":3,"children":[{"text":"Quiet Rooms"}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"The outcome is a ~20 minute documentary film called “Quiet Rooms” that tells the story of the immediate and long term impacts of gun violence in Boston."}]}]},{"type":"layout-area","children":[{"type":"heading","level":4,"children":[{"text":"Creators"}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Sabrina Carr, student"}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Shaulita Francis, partner"}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Rachele Gardner, Engagement Lab staff"}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Olivia Goldberg, student"}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Angelina Gu, student"}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Anna Porter, partner"}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Carla Sheffield, partner"}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Cole Tatham, student"}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"LeAnn Taylor, partner"}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"John Yang, TA and partner"}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Eric Gordon, professor"}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Theodore \"Regge\" Life, professor"}]},{"type":"heading","level":4,"children":[{"text":"Partner"}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"","italic":true},{"href":"https://ldbpeaceinstitute.org","type":"link","children":[{"text":"Peace Institute"}]},{"text":""}]},{"type":"heading","level":4,"children":[{"text":"Department"}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":""},{"href":"https://www.emerson.edu/academics/academic-departments/visual-media-arts","type":"link","children":[{"text":"Visual and Media Arts"}]},{"text":""}]},{"type":"heading","level":4,"children":[{"text":"Contact"}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"eric_gordon@emerson.edu"}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"theodore_life@emerson.edu"}]}]}]},{"type":"heading","level":3,"children":[{"text":"Studio Outcomes"}]},{"type":"component-block","props":{"video":{"label":"Quiet Rooms","thumb":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/1422970532-23861873f4eeecd50dbcdcf692a557391ce2f75e0cdc82314dc6c54f8fe5cca1-d_1920x1080?r=pad","value":"https://player.vimeo.com/video/704690044?h=1983e7467b","thumbSm":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/1422970532-23861873f4eeecd50dbcdcf692a557391ce2f75e0cdc82314dc6c54f8fe5cca1-d_200x150?r=pad"}},"children":[{"type":"component-inline-prop","children":[{"text":""}]}],"component":"video"},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":""}]}]}},"relatedItems":[{"name":"VM495: Documentary Studio (Spring 2020)","key":"vm495-documentary-studio-spring-2020","filters":[],"thumbnail":{"publicId":"tngvi/studios/cl282fdar00015ips34jycc6j"}},{"name":"Co-Creation of VR and 360-Video","key":"co-creation-of-vr-and-360-video","filters":[],"thumbnail":{"publicId":"tngvi/studios/cl282eiqr00005ips1hed1wqw"}},{"name":"VM 495: Documentary Studio (Spring 2022)","key":"vm-495-documentary-studio-spring-2022","filters":[],"thumbnail":{"publicId":"tngvi/studios/cl282fk8700025ipscl4b2z3j"}},{"name":"TH315 Performing Solutions: A Dramatic Approach to Gun Violence Prevention","key":"th315-performing-solutions-a-dramatic-approach-to-gun-violence-prevention","filters":[],"thumbnail":{"publicId":"tngvi/studios/cl4hcap8w0001t4psh8jg9gf4"}}]},"__N_SSG":true}
